## Course Format

This course is scheduled to meet on every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday 11:00 am - 12:20 pm from July 5th to August 12th.

The course will include lecture on theory, examples with real-world applications and discussion based on the concepts of the day. 


### Prerequisites

This course has no prerequisite—any exposure to calculus would be a plus but is not required. However, if needed, the related concepts will be covered in the lecture.

## Homework and Quiz

There is no assignment for this course -- I know the program has tight schedule, so please come to the lecture and try to pay attention to your best and ENJOY!

There would be supplementary [reading materials](schedule.md) that you can read by yourself. I recommend you to read it before coming to the lecture. Reading materials would provide a wide range of examples which allow you to better understand the lecture.

There will be 2 quizzes on July 21st, Aug 11th. As this course is *not* toward the official credit, the quizzes are designed to help you better understand the course material, but not to discourage you. 

## Participation

You can always learn more when collaborating with others in class. For the last 20 minutes of lecture would be group discussion. The instructor will introduce the theory, related concepts and examples, and the students will try to apply these concepts into real-world situations during group discussion time.

Active participation during the discussion is highly encouraged.
