# Introduction to Statistics

This webpage is designed to host all the resources for 2022 CAAP(Chicago Academic Achievement Program) Statistics. 

## Course Description

This course aims to introduce students to statistical methods and data analysis using statistical software, widely applicable to a wide range of studies. We will be motivated by practical questions from biological, physical, and social sciences. The course aims to nurture the intuition to understand real-life data and, at the same time, to explain the data based on suitable statistical theory. Students will learn to take a question such as
*	Does this medicine effectively prevent a cold?
* Does this commercial bring more customers to the store?
And will be able to decompose these questions into accessible statistical hypotheses:
* Is the difference in the proportion of having a clod “significant” between the experimental and control groups?
* Does the number of customers visiting the store “significantly” improve after the commercial?


### Prerequisites
This course has no prerequisite—any exposure to calculus would be a plus but is not required. However, if needed, the related concepts will be covered in the lecture.
