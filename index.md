# Introduction to Statistics

This webpage is designed to host all the resources for 2022 [CAAP](https://college.uchicago.edu/student-services/chicago-academic-achievement-program) Statistics. 

## Course Description

This course aims to introduce students to statistical methods and data analysis using statistical software, widely applicable to a wide range of studies. We will try to answer many practical questions using rigorous statistical framework. The course aims to nurture the intuition to understand real-life data and, at the same time, to explain the data based on suitable statistical theory. Students will learn to take a question such as

*	Does this medicine effectively prevent a cold?
* Does this commercial bring more customers to the store?

and will be able to answer them through hypothesis testing framework. The course will not only focus on the theory but also help you deal with the real-world data using statistical programming, R.

### Prerequisites
This course has no prerequisiteâ€”any exposure to calculus would be a plus but is not required. However, if needed, the related concepts will be covered in the lecture.
